# cantilever-beam-experiment
The main purpose of this program is to analyze experimental data and determine whether or not a cantilever beam
acts like a regular spring based on the principles of Hooke’s law. To answer the aforementioned thesis, this program
would process the data sets obtained from three different experiments, model the relationships of the data sets
mathematically, and then produce of graph of Displacement (Meters) VS Force (Newtons) for each data set. From
the graph we would then be able to visualize the relationship of the data sets (especially the trend line/”line of best
fit”) and qualitatively infer whether or not the cantilever beam acts like a regular spring.
